The TDS-1 is the first guitar pedal I ever built, and it shows. It's simple design is well suited for amateur and begginer use, since it doesn't require a large number of components.

The reason why I designed and built a distortion pedal as my first pedal instead of something like a fuzz is solely because I found it to be well balanced between difficuly and the "rewarding" feeling you get after building it.

The first version I built is also a bespoke one, a tad bit different to what's presented in the schematic. It does look a bit sketchy, but i promise, it works like a charm. Sadly i forgot to record any demos with it.
